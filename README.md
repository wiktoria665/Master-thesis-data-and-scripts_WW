<h3 align="center">#### Repository contains data relating to calculation of the fitness of strains with lower fitness (YPW2879 and YPW2943), gating of flow cytometer results and scripts needed for analysis.</h3>

### Table of contents:  
* #### **_competition plots_**
**data from the beginning of the main experiment**  
competition tested for strains YPW2879 and YPW2943 (lower fitness strains), presented as Log2 of yellow (lower fitness strains) to green (higher fitness strain) ratio
* #### **_experiment_strains fractions_**
 **the main experiment data**  
count of singlet green (YPWCOMP, higher fitness) and singlet yellow (YPW2879 and YPW2943, lower fitness) cells, fractions of green cells and yellow cells, in different time points of experiment  
* #### **_experiment_gating_part1-3_**  
 **the main experiment data**  
gates for separating green (YPWCOMP, higher fitness) and yellow (YPW2879 and YPW2943, lower fitness) singlets
* #### **_gating of flow cytometer results_**
 **data from the beginning of the main experiment**  
 gating of singlets from strains YPW2879 / YPW2943 and the lower fitness competitor
* #### **_test of the sorter_**
 **data from the beginning of the main experiment**  
 photos of culture plates of strains: YPWCOMP, YPW2879 and YPW2943; obtained after sorting single cell in each well, test of sorter accuracy
* #### **_competition results_**
 **data from the beginning of the main experiment**  
 obtaining fitness values for strains YPW2879 and YPW2943, fitness was calculated from the three initial results, since after that some wells were lacking the competitor (with lower fitness)
* #### **_fitness boxplot_**
**data from the beginning of the main experiment**  
fitness plotted for YPW2879 and YPW2943 on a graph  
* #### **_fitness count before the experiment_**
**data from before the main experiment**  
calculation of fitness of eleven tested strains, which were considered for the main experiment  
* #### **_script for fitness_**
**data from the beginning of the main experiment**  
script for calculating fitness for strains YPW2879 and YPW2943  
* #### **_script for gating_**
**the main experiment data**  
script for automatic gate eliminating debris and singlets with fuorescence below 1200
