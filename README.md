# Master-thesis-data-and-scripts_WW
#### Repository contains data relating to calculation of the fitness of strains with lower fitness (YPW2879 and YPW2943), gating of flow cytometer results and scripts needed for analysis.

### Table of contents:  
* #### **_competition plots_**
**data from the beginning of the main experiment**  
competition tested for strains YPW2879 and YPW2943 (worse fitness strains), presented as Log2 of yellow (worse fitness strains) to green (higher fitness strain) ratio
* #### **_experiment_strains fractions_**
**main experiment data**  
count of singlet green (YPWCOMP, higher fitness) and singlet yellow (YPW2879 and YPW2943, lower fitness) cells, fractions of green cells and yellow cells
